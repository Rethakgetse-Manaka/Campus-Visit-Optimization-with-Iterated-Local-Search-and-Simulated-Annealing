# Campus-Visit-Optimization-with-Iterated-Local-Search-and-Simulated-Annealing
This repository contains Java implementations of two algorithms, Iterated Local Search (ILS) and Simulated Annealing (SA), designed to find the most efficient route for a student travelling to different campuses. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled while visiting each campus exactly once and returning to the starting point.
